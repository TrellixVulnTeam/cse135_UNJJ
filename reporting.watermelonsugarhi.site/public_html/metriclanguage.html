    - Why: In an increasingly connected world, multi-language websites are becoming more and more common.      
And user experience and customer support are very important to every companyâ€™s success.   
By analysing data like this we should be able to find out what user speaking what laguage are using our website,      
We could develop our webpage using different languages that are commanly used in our user group. We choose a word cloud
becasue using a word cloud we can easily tell which langauge is the dominant language for our users, and as for right now
we don't really need to know how many exactly, the size of the word in the word cloud gives us a pretty good estimate.  
</p>
<p>
    - How: We are taking data from our static datas, detecting browser preference is the most common and most effective way 
    used by websites to detect your preferred language automatically compare to looking up to ip address, which is     
    hard and tedious. We use a word cloud.
</p>
<p>
    - Read from chart: From the chart we can see that the language used among our users is Engilsh, but along we have seen some
 Chinses users, Japanese users, etc. If we are making a to Client website, we can definately consider having different
 language for our website. 
</p>
<p>
    - Bebefit: We could develop features like automatically detecting users prefered languages, for examples when you are       
    using google search in Japan,when  you search apple, the top feed will taking you to apple.com/jp/ instead of apple.com    
    In this way, the user do not need to scrolldown to the end of the page then change the language/region. Thus, this  
    will bring good user experience to our web users.
