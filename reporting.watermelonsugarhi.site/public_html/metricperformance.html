    - Why:  We want to keep track of how is our website performing - is it too slow for our user? 
    is the load time acceptable given the page transfer size? 
    If it's too slow for users, Is the page compression working properly? 
    We use a Gird for our data because grid can sort data easily and allow us to compare directly with other data.    
</p>
<p>
    - How:    So we need data from the performance data. We obtianed duration of page load, page transfer size,    
    and page decoded size.  and we sort our data in descending order. This way we can compare the slowest time and     
   page size, and determine if that is acceptable. We can also look at other data to determine if it was an exeption that it was slow.
   We can not view all time at once and without the compare we will not able to tell     
    if this druation time is fast or slow.    
</p>
<p>
    - Read from Grid: At the time I was wtring this report, the longest duration is, 624.4, and the shortest is 50.2.
    So this is very obvious that the fastest is way faster than slowest. So, if we trace back thru the session id, we can 
    find what request this was and what devices was this session on, and we can utilize for them on our website.
</p>
<p>
    - Bebefit:  By analysing the response time, we are able to trace back and improve out website, which essentially falls back to 
    improve our user experience and keep and bring traffic to the site.
