    - Why:  Device upgrade is more and more frequent right now, there are several devices coming out every year.
    those new devices have stronger CPU, larger RAM, faster storage, so they can handle big website easily. However, not    
    all users will get a new phone or a new labtop every year. So, when making a website, we need to consider those     
    devices too. We need to make our website run fast on old devices too.
    Also, some user agents will be banned from the website because they think this agent is a bot. By analyzing this, we could
    reduce the possiblity of blocking our real user. We use a pie chart because we want to know the porpotion of each user agent,
    and we want a chart that can allow us to tell the difference in the propotion of users for each user agent.
</p>
<p>
    - How: We are taking the data from our static datas - User Agent. And we are using pie chart to show what kind of devices   
    are mostly used among our users; that way we know what agent are most common ones, so we could rule out those are not   
    so common. Also, we could tell from the data, what operating system my users are using, what browsers they are using.    
    And we could adjust our website accrordingly.   
</p>
<p>
    - Read from Chart: We can see from the pie chart that big part of our users are using Windows computer, but some of iphone, ipad, mac 
    users too. For me, when I open the website, it is too big for my phone, and I will have to manually adjust it to proper size for me. So, with
    this data, we can make our website to be auto adjust to different devices.
</p>
<p>
    - Bebefit: By doing this we could improve the user experience. And users will find our website is easier to use(faster, adjust to      
    their devices, etc.). This is a win-win situation.
